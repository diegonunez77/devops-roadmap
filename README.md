# 🛠️ DevOps Roadmap: From Self-Taught to Job-Ready

> ⚠️ **Note:**  
> This roadmap does **not** reflect a beginner’s journey. I already have a strong technical foundation and am using this roadmap to sharpen, certify, and formalize my DevOps skill set for job readiness. I'll be refreshing my knowledge on core tools throughout and especially at the beginning of the journey. Here’s a quick snapshot of my background:
>
> - 🐧 **Linux:** 2+ years running Arch Linux as my daily driver - experienced in configuring development environments from scratch, managing packages with pacman, yay, and the AUR, switching between shells (Zsh, Bash), and solving low-level system issues 
> - 🧠 **Git, GitHub:** Used daily across personal and collaborative projects  
> - 🐳 **Docker:** 1 year experience writing Dockerfiles, managing containers, and using Docker Compose  
> - 📦 **DevOps Stack:** Familiar with the landscape of CI/CD, IAC, container orchestration, and monitoring tools  
> - 🧑‍💻 **Programming:** 2 years of intermediate experience with Python, React, Flask, and AI model integration  
> - 🤖 **AI-Driven Development:** 1 year leveraging tools like Claude, Cursor, and Windsurf for accelerated dev workflows
>
> This roadmap is about going from **skilled self-taught dev** to **certified, polished, and job-ready engineer**.


This is my personal DevOps learning journey — a self-paced roadmap to become job-ready and land a DevOps role without a CS degree. My goal is to master modern DevOps tools, build a solid portfolio, and pass key certifications.
